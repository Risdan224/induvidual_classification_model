6 Individual Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification Model — Study Case: Credit Risk Analysis

Currently, there are many classification models that can be used, such as ensemble learning and deep learning. But in this article, I will discuss individual classification models or what is usually called ‘weak learners’. These models will be used to create a classification model that determines the status of someone’s credit.

There are 6 classification models that will be discussed here, and each model has its own unique algorithm.

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Linear Discriminant Analysis
5. K-Nearest Neighbor\
6. Naive Bayes
